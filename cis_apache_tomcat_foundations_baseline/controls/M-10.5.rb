  desc  "The manager application allows administrators to manage Tomcat
remotely via a web interface. The manager application should be renamed to make
it harder for attackers or automated scripts to locate. Obscurity can be
helpful when used with other security measures. By relocating the manager
applications, an attacker will need to guess its location rather than simply
navigate to the standard location in order to carry out an attack. "
