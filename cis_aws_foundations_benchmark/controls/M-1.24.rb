  title "1.24 Ensure IAM policies that allow full '*:*' administrative
privileges are not created (Scored)"
  desc  "IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users,
groups, or roles. It is recommended and considered a standard security advice
to grant least privilegeâ€”that is, granting only the permissions required to
perform a task. Determine what users need to do and then craft policies for
them that let the users perform only those tasks, instead of allowing full
administrative privileges. It's more secure to start with a minimum set of
permissions and grant additional permissions as necessary, rather than starting
with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later.
Providing full administrative privileges instead of restricting to the minimum
set of permissions that the user is required to do exposes the resources to
potentially unwanted actions. IAM policies that have a statement with 'Effect':
'Allow' with 'Action': '*' over 'Resource': '*' should be removed. "
