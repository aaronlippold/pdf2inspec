  title "4.5 Ensure Content trust for Docker is Enabled (Scored)"
  desc  "
    Content trust is disabled by default. You should enable it.
    Content trust provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent
to and received
    from remote Docker registries. These signatures allow client-side
verification of the
    integrity and publisher of specific image tags. This ensures provenance of
container images.
