set to\n400 (Scored)"
  desc  "
    Verify that the Docker server certificate key file (the file that is passed
alongwith --tlskey
    parameter) has permissions of 400.
    The Docker server certificate key file should be protected from any
tampering or unneeded
    reads. It holds the private key for the Docker server certificate. Hence,
it must have
    permissions of 400 to maintain the integrity of the Docker server
certificate.
