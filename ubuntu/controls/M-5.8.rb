  title "5.8 Ensure only needed ports are open on the container (Scored)"
  desc  "
    Dockerfile for a container image defines the ports to be opened by default
on a container
    instance. The list of ports may or may not be relevant to the application
you are running
    within the container.
    A container can be run just with the ports defined in the Dockerfile for
its image or can be
    arbitrarily passed run time parameters to open a list of ports.
Additionally, Overtime,
    Dockerfile may undergo various changes and the list of exposed ports may or
may not be
    relevant to the application you are running within the container. Opening
unneeded ports
    increase the attack surface of the container and the containerized
application. As a
    recommended practice, do not open unneeded ports.
