    Rotate root CA certificates as appropriate.
    Docker Swarm uses mutual TLS for clustering operations amongst its nodes.
Certificate
    rotation ensures that in an event such as compromised node or key, it is
difficult to
    impersonate a node. Node certificates depend upon root CA certificates. For
operational
    security, it is important to rotate these frequently. Currently, root CA
certificates are not
    rotated automatically. You should thus establish a process to rotate it at
the desired
    frequency.
