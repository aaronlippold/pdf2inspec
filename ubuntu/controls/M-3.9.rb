    Verify that the TLS CA certificate file (the file that is passed alongwith
--tlscacert
    parameter) is owned and group-owned by root.
    The TLS CA certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is
used to
    authenticate Docker server based on given CA certificate. Hence, it must be
owned and
    group-owned by root to maintain the integrity of the CA certificate.
