    Separate management plane traffic from data plane traffic.
    Separating the management plane traffic from data plane traffic ensures
that these traffics
    are on their respective paths. These paths could then be individually
monitored and could
    be tied to different traffic control policies and monitoring. It also
ensures that management
    plane is always reachable despite the huge volume of data flow.
