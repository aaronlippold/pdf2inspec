  title "5.17 Ensure host devices are not directly exposed to containers
(Not\nScored)"
  desc  "
    Host devices can be directly exposed to containers at runtime. Do not
directly expose host
    devices to containers especially for containers that are not trusted.
    The --device option exposes the host devices to the containers and
consequently, the
    containers can directly access such host devices. You would not require the
container to
    run in privileged mode to access and manipulate the host devices. By
default, the
    container will be able to read, write and mknod these devices.
Additionally, it is possible for
    containers to remove block devices from the host. Hence, do not expose host
devices to
    containers directly.
    If at all, you would want to expose the host device to a container, use the
sharing
    permissions appropriately:



    r - read only
    w - writable
    m - mknod allowed
