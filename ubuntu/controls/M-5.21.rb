  title "5.21 Ensure the default seccomp profile is not Disabled (Scored)"
  desc  "
    Seccomp filtering provides a means for a process to specify a filter for
incoming system
    calls. The default Docker seccomp profile works on whitelist basis and
allows 311 system
    calls blocking all others. It should not be disabled unless it hinders your
container
    application usage.
    A large number of system calls are exposed to every userland process with
many of them
    going unused for the entire lifetime of the process. Most of the
applications do not need all
    the system calls and thus benefit by having a reduced set of available
system calls. The
    reduced set of system calls reduces the total kernel surface exposed to the
application and
    thus improvises application security.
