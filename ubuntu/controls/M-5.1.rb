  desc  "
    AppArmor is an effective and easy-to-use Linux application security system.
It is available
    on quite a few Linux distributions by default such as Debian and Ubuntu.
    AppArmor protects the Linux OS and applications from various threats by
enforcing
    security policy which is also known as AppArmor profile. You can create
your own
    AppArmor profile for containers or use the Docker's default AppArmor
profile. This would
    enforce security policies on the containers as defined in the profile.
