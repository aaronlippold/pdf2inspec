  title "5.16 Ensure the host's IPC namespace is not shared (Scored)"
  desc  "
    IPC (POSIX/SysV IPC) namespace provides separation of named shared memory
segments,
    semaphores and message queues. IPC namespace on the host thus should not be
shared
    with the containers and should remain isolated.
    IPC namespace provides separation of IPC between the host and containers.
If the host's
    IPC namespace is shared with the container, it would basically allow
processes within the
    container to see all of the IPC on the host system. This breaks the benefit
of IPC level
    isolation between the host and the containers. Someone having access to the
container can
    eventually manipulate the host IPC. This can be catastrophic. Hence, do not
share the host's
    IPC namespace with the containers.
