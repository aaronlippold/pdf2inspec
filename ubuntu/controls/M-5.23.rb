  desc  "
    Do not docker exec with --user option.
    Using --user option in docker exec executes the command within the
container as that
    user. This could potentially be insecure and unsafe to do especially when
you are running
    containers with dropped capabilities or with enhanced restrictions.
    For example, suppose your container is running as tomcat user (or any other
non-root
    user), it would be possible to run a command through docker exec as
rootwith -user=root option. This could potentially be dangerous.
