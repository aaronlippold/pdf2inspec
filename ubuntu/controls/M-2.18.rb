  title "2.18 Ensure containers are restricted from acquiring new
privileges(Scored)"
  desc  "
    Restrict containers from acquiring additional privileges via suid or sgid
bits, by default.
    A process can set the no_new_priv bit in the kernel. It persists across
fork, clone and
    execve. The no_new_priv bit ensures that the process or its children
processes do not gain
    any additional privileges via suid or sgid bits. This way a lot of
dangerous operations
    become a lot less dangerous because there is no possibility of subverting
privileged
    binaries.
    Setting this at the daemon level ensures that by default all new containers
are restricted
    from acquiring new privileges.
