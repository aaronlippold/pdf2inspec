(Not\nScored)"
  desc  "
    Containers tend to be minimal and slim down versions of the Operating
System. Do not
    install anything that does not justify the purpose of container.
    Bloating containers with unnecessary software could possibly increase the
attack surface
    of the container. This also voids the concept of minimal and slim down
versions of
    container images. Hence, do not install anything else apart from what is
truly needed for
    the purpose of the container.

the standard Redhat/Centos/Debian\nimages if you can. Some of the options
include BusyBox and Alpine.\nNot only does this trim your image size from
>150Mb to ~20 Mb, there are also fewer tools\nand paths to escalate privileges.
