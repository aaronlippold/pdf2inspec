  title "4.2 Ensure that containers use trusted base images (Not Scored)"
  desc  "
    Ensure that the container image is written either from scratch or is based
on another
    established and trusted base image downloaded over a secure channel.
    Official repositories are Docker images curated and optimized by the Docker
community or
    the vendor. There could be other potentially unsafe public repositories.
Caution should be
    exercised when obtaining container images from Docker and third parties to
how they will
    be used for your organization's data.
