  title "5.25 Ensure the container is restricted from acquiring
additional\nprivileges (Scored)"
  desc  "
    Restrict the container from acquiring additional privileges via suid or
sgid bits.
    A process can set the no_new_priv bit in the kernel. It persists across
fork, clone and
    execve. The no_new_priv bit ensures that the process or its children
processes do not gain
    any additional privileges via suid or sgid bits. This way a lot of
dangerous operations
    become a lot less dangerous because there is no possibility of subverting
privileged
    binaries.
