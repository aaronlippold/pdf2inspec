the\nimage (Not Scored)"
  desc  "
    Always ensure that you are using the latest version of the image within
your repository and
    not the cached older versions.
    Multiple docker commands such as docker pull, docker run, etc. are known to
have an
    issue that by default, they extract the local copy of the image, if
present, even though there
    is an updated version of the image with the \"same tag\" in the upstream
repository. This
    could lead to using older and vulnerable images.

assigned by default is still\nvulnerable to caching attacks) to avoid
extracting the cached older versions. Version\npinning mechanisms should be
used for base images, packages, and entire images too. You\ncan customize
version pinning rules as per your requirements.\n"
