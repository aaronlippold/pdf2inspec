    Verify that the Docker server certificate file (the file that is passed
alongwith --tlscert
    parameter) has permissions of 444 or more restrictive.
    The Docker server certificate file should be protected from any tampering.
It is used to
    authenticate Docker server based on the given server certificate. Hence, it
must have
    permissions of 444 to maintain the integrity of the certificate.
