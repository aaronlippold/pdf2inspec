container\nimage (Scored)"
  desc  "
    Add HEALTHCHECK instruction in your docker container images to perform the
health check
    on running containers.
    One of the important security triads is availability. Adding HEALTHCHECK
instruction to your
    container image ensures that the docker engine periodically checks the
running container
    instances against that instruction to ensure that the instances are still
working.
    Based on the reported health status, the docker engine could then exit
non-working
    containers and instantiate new ones.
