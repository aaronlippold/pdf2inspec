  desc  "
    Verify that the Docker server certificate key file (the file that is passed
alongwith --tlskey
    parameter) is owned and group-owned by root.
    The Docker server certificate key file should be protected from any
tampering or unneeded
    reads. It holds the private key for the Docker server certificate. Hence,
it must be owned
    and group-owned by root to maintain the integrity of the Docker server
certificate.
