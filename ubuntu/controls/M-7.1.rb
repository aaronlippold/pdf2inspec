    Do not enable swarm mode on a docker engine instance unless needed.
    By default, a Docker engine instance will not listen on any network ports,
with all
    communications with the client coming over the Unix socket. When Docker
swarm mode is
    enabled on a docker engine instance, multiple network ports are opened on
the system and
    made available to other systems on the network for the purposes of cluster
management
    and node communications.
    Opening network ports on a system increase its attack surface and this
should be avoided
    unless required.
