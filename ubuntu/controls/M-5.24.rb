  title "5.24 Ensure cgroup usage is confirmed (Scored)"
  desc  "
    It is possible to attach to a particular cgroup on container run.
Confirming cgroup usage
    would ensure that containers are running under defined cgroups.
    System administrators typically define cgroups under which containers are
supposed to
    run. Even if cgroups are not explicitly defined by the system
administrators, containers run
    under docker cgroup by default.
    At run-time, it is possible to attach to a different cgroup other than the
one that was
    expected to be used. This usage should be monitored and confirmed. By
attaching to a
    different cgroup than the one that is expected, excess permissions and
resources might be
    granted to the container and thus, can prove to be unsafe.
