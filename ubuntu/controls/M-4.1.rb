    Create a non-root user for the container in the Dockerfile for the
container image.
    It is a good practice to run the container as a non-root user, if possible.
Though user
    namespace mapping is now available, if a user is already defined in the
container image, the
    container is run as that user by default and specific user namespace
remapping is not
    required.
