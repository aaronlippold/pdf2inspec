  title "4.8 Ensure setuid and setgid permissions are removed in the images(Not
Scored)"
  desc  "
    Removing setuid and setgid permissions in the images would prevent
privilege escalation
    attacks in the containers.
    setuid and setgid permissions could be used for elevating privileges. While
these
    permissions are at times legitimately needed, these could potentially be
used in privilege
    escalation attacks. Thus, you should consider dropping these permissions
for the packages
    which do not need them within the images.
