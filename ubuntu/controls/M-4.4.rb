  title "4.4 Ensure images are scanned and rebuilt to include security
patches(Not Scored)"
  desc  "
    Images should be scanned \"frequently\" for any vulnerabilities. Rebuild
the images to
    include patches and then instantiate new containers from it.
    Vulnerabilities are loopholes/bugs that can be exploited and security
patches are updates
    to resolve these vulnerabilities. We can use image vulnerability scanning
tools to find any
    kind of vulnerabilities within the images and then check for available
patches to mitigate
    these vulnerabilities. Patches update the system to the most recent code
base. Being on the
    current code base is important because that's where vendors focus on fixing
problems.
    Evaluate the security patches before applying and follow the patching best
practices.
    Also, it would be better if, image vulnerability scanning tools could
perform binary level
    analysis or hash based verification instead of just version string matching.
