    Avoid experimental features in production.
    Experimental is now a runtime docker daemon flag instead of a separate
build. Passing -experimental as a runtime flag to the docker daemon, activates
experimental features.
    Experimental is now considered a stable release, but with a couple of
features which might
    not have tested and guaranteed API stability.
