(Scored)"
  desc  "
    All Docker containers and their data and metadata is stored under
/var/lib/docker
    directory. By default, /var/lib/docker would be mounted under / or /var
partitions based
    on availability.
    Docker depends on /var/lib/docker as the default directory where all Docker
related files,
    including the images, are stored. This directory might fill up fast and
soon Docker and the
    host could become unusable. So, it is advisable to create a separate
partition (logical
    volume) for storing Docker files.
