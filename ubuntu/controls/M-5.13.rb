  title "5.13 Ensure incoming container traffic is binded to a specific
host\ninterface (Scored)"
  desc  "
    By default, Docker containers can make connections to the outside world,
but the outside
    world cannot connect to containers. Each outgoing connection will appear to
originate
    from one of the host machine's own IP addresses. Only allow container
services to be
    contacted through a specific external interface on the host machine.
    If you have multiple network interfaces on your host machine, the container
can accept
    connections on the exposed ports on any network interface. This might not
be desired and
    may not be secured. Many a times a particular interface is exposed
externally and services
    such as intrusion detection, intrusion prevention, firewall, load
balancing, etc. are run on
    those interfaces to screen incoming public traffic. Hence, you should not
accept incoming
    connections on any interface. You should only allow incoming connections
from a
    particular external interface.
