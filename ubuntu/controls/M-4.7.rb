  title "4.7 Ensure update instructions are not use alone in the Dockerfile
(Not\nScored)"
  desc  "
    Do not use update instructions such as apt-get update alone or in a single
line in the
    Dockerfile.
    Adding the update instructions in a single line on the Dockerfile will
cache the update layer.
    Thus, when you build any image later using the same instruction, previously
cached update
    layer will be used. This could potentially deny any fresh updates to go in
the later builds.
