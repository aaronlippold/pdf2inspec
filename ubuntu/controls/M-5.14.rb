  title "5.14 Ensure 'on-failure' container restart policy is set to '5'
(Scored)"
  desc  "
    Using the --restart flag in docker run command you can specify a restart
policy for how a
    container should or should not be restarted on exit. You should choose the
on-failure
    restart policy and limit the restart attempts to 5.
    If you indefinitely keep trying to start the container, it could possibly
lead to a denial of
    service on the host. It could be an easy way to do a distributed denial of
service attack
    especially if you have many containers on the same host. Additionally,
ignoring the exit
    status of the container and always attempting to restart the container
leads to noninvestigation of the root cause behind containers getting
terminated. If a container gets
    terminated, you should investigate on the reason behind it instead of just
attempting to
    restart it indefinitely. Thus, it is recommended to use on-failure restart
policy and limit it
    to maximum of 5 restart attempts.
