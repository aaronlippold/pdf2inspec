    Verify that the Docker server certificate file (the file that is passed
alongwith --tlscert
    parameter) is owned and group-owned by root.
    The Docker server certificate file should be protected from any tampering.
It is used to
    authenticate Docker server based on the given server certificate. Hence, it
must be owned
    and group-owned by root to maintain the integrity of the certificate.
