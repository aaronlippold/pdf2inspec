    Verify that the TLS CA certificate file (the file that is passed alongwith
--tlscacert
    parameter) has permissions of 444 or more restrictive.
    The TLS CA certificate file should be protected from any tampering. It is
used to
    authenticate Docker server based on given CA certificate. Hence, it must
have permissions
    of 444 to maintain the integrity of the CA certificate.
