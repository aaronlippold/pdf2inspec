    Do not store any secrets in Dockerfiles.
    Dockerfiles could be backtracked easily by using native Docker commands
such as docker
    history and various tools and utilities. Also, as a general practice, image
publishers
    provide Dockerfiles to build the credibility for their images. Hence, the
secrets within these
    Dockerfiles could be easily exposed and potentially be exploited.
