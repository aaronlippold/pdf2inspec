  desc  "
    Mount propagation mode allows mounting volumes in shared, slave or private
mode on a
    container. Do not use shared mount propagation mode until needed.
    A shared mount is replicated at all mounts and the changes made at any
mount point are
    propagated to all mounts. Mounting a volume in shared mode does not
restrict any other
    container to mount and make changes to that volume. This might be
catastrophic if the
    mounted volume is sensitive to changes. Do not set mount propagation mode
to shared
    until needed.
