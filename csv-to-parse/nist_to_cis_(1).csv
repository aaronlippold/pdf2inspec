For applications that are not web-based, specific application firewalls should be deployed if such tools are available for the given application type.  If the traffic is encrypted, the device should either sit behind the encryption or be capable of decrypting the traffic prior to analysis.  If neither option is appropriate, a host-based web application firewall should be deployed.",Y,Dealing with encrypted/tunneled traffic requires more planning and resources.,,Application,18.3,"For in-house developed software, ensure that explicit error checking is performed and documented for all input, including for size, data type, and acceptable ranges or formats. ",Y,,,Application,18.4,"Test in-house-developed and third-party-procured web applications for common security weaknesses using automated remote web application scanners prior to deployment, whenever updates are made to the application, and on a regular recurring basis. In particular, input validation and output encoding routines of application software should be reviewed and tested.",Y,,,Application,18.5,Do not display system error messages to end-users (output sanitization).,Y,,,Application,18.6,Maintain separate environments for production and nonproduction systems. Developers should not typically have unmonitored access to production environments.,Y,,,Application,18.7,"For applications that rely on a database, use standard hardening configuration templates.
